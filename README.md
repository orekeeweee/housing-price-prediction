# Chicago Housing Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting housing sale prices in Cook County, Chicago using a structured machine learning pipeline. It consists of two main parts: exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression-based modeling.

The work was carried out as part of a data science learning project and demonstrates end-to-end handling of real-world tabular data, from cleaning and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

## 📊 Project Structure

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Inspects distributions, missing values, and feature relationships.
- Performs data cleaning (e.g., dropping redundant features, handling NAs).
- Visualizes geographical and temporal trends in house prices.

### 2. **Predictive Modeling**
- Implements multiple regression models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge and Lasso Regression
  - Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Performs hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- Evaluates models using RMSE and residual analysis.
